# Frontend Mentor - NFT Preview Card Component



## This project is from series of projects offered by Frontend Mentor, with the intention of growing into a well-rounded programmer. Currently I've been doing a lot of work in React, and realized that I need to brush up on CSS as well as general JS knowledge. These challenges provide design style sheets, a few production images, and the rest is up to the programmer to complete the challenge. There are no restrictions on how one finishes a project, and instead of following a tutorial these projects allows one to go through the processes used by programmers in professional settings. 

## The challenge:

Your challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
